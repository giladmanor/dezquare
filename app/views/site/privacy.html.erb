						This Privacy Policy explains how Dèzquare collects and uses data. If not otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the Dèzquare Terms of Use, which are available at <a href="/site/terms">www.dezquare.com/site/terms</a> (the “Terms”).

Dèzquare respects your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains Dèzquare’s policies regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of any information we receive. 

<h3>Information We Collect</h3> 

In order to use our Site and Services, you will be required to register and provide us with certain Personal Information. We also collect Personal Information when you make use of the Site and Services. “Personal Information” means information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. It is your voluntary decision whether to provide us with any such Personal Information, but if you refuse to provide such information we may not be able to register you to use the Site and the Services. 

If you use the Site or the Services by logging in through “Facebook Connect” or another social network, we may also receive personal information about you which is provided by such social network. Please check the policies of such social network in order to understand what information we receive.

We also collect certain information that is not Personal Information, such as regarding your responses to and other interaction with the Taste Analysis Software, any description of yourself you may upload to the Site, your browsing history on the Site, and any information regarding your interactions or negotiations with any Customers or Designers through the Site or Services. In addition, when you use the Site and the Services certain information may be automatically gathered about your device, such as the version of your operating system or browser.

<h3>How We Protect Information</h3>

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We will delete any information provided to us by a user upon the receipt of a written request by such user. We cannot restore information that we have deleted.

<h3>How We Use Information</h3>

Except as expressly set forth herein, we will not share your Personal Information with third parties without your explicit permission, except when required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order or in order to cooperate with an investigation by a law enforcement body. We may use Personal Information internally – for example, to help diagnose problems with our servers, to make Dèzquare more useful, or to customize Dèzquare and personalize its content for you.

In addition, we will provide the results of your interaction with the Taste Analysis Software to potential Designers. This helps Designers evaluate your tastes and needs.

In addition, by analyzing all information we receive, including all information concerning users and ride shares, we may compile statistical information across a variety of platforms and users (“Statistical Information”). Statistical Information helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires. Statistical Information is anonymous and we will not link Statistical Information to any Personal Information. We may share such Statistical Information with our partners, without restriction, on commercial terms that we can determine in our sole discretion. We use Google Analytics in order to receive an analysis of the use of our Site and Services. As such, Google may have access to certain Non-Personal Information in respect of your use of the Site and Services. Such information is subject to Google’s applicable privacy policies.

<h3>Feedback</h3>

When you give feedback in respect of Designers through Dèzquare or through other social media platforms, please remember that any information disclosed in this venue may be automatically made public, and such information will not be considered Personal Information by Dèzquare. You should exercise caution when disclosing any information (including Personal Information) in such a venue, as you do not know who will access or use such information and for what purposes.

<h3>Cookies</h3> 

A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to a visitor's browser. The browser provides this piece of text to the device of the originating visitor when this visitor returns. Dèzquare uses cookies to help personalize your Dèzquare experience. A “persistent” cookie may be used to help save your settings and customizations across site visits. Also, if you log in to Dèzquare, such a cookie will be used to recognize you as a valid user so you will not need to log in each time you use Dèzquare. Most Web browsers are initially configured to accept cookies, but you can change this setting so your browser either refuses all cookies or informs you when a cookie is being sent. Also, you are free to delete any existing cookies at any time. Please note that some features of Dèzquare may not function properly when cookies are disabled or removed.

For example, we may send your information to any countries outside the United States or the European Economic Area. All our subcontractors will be subject to non-disclosure and non-use obligations. Nevertheless, some countries may have levels of protection of personal and other information which are not as high as in your country of residence or business.
