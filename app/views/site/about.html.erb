						<h3>What is dèzquare?</h3>
						<p>dèzquare is changing the game of graphic design services, by mapping your taste and matching you to a compatible graphic designer  by playing a quick game. </p>
						<h3>Why "dèzquare"?</h3>
						<p>
							The name dèzquare is a combination of the words - design and square. We used the letter - "z" instead of "s" in design to give it a fresh and urban vibe, and we chose the word - "Square" as a metaphor for a public square and its importance as the center of activity and events in a city. 
						</p>
						<h3>How does it work?</h3>
						<p>
							Finding the designer you’ll love at dèzquare is easy as playing a "Hot or Not" game.<br/>
							We put an end to the endless browsing through portfolios and the uncertainty of selecting a bid or starting a design contest. Instead you play a short game. The game takes you quickly through designs and our smart algorithm maps your taste. With the analysis of your taste, we match you to a graphic designer that you’ll love and we provide the designer a thorough analysis of your "Likes" and taste. 
							You no longer need to search for examples or waste your time trying to explain to the designer the product you want.
